pyteomics.tandem2xml - a pepXML writer and Tandem2XML converter
---------------------------------------------------------------

**pyteomics.tandem2xml** is a module based on the
`pyteomics <http://pythonhosted.org/pyteomics/>`_ package that
allows creation of
`pepXML <http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Formats:pepXML>`_
files from Python objects of a certain structure. The structure corresponds to
tokens generated by the parser of X!Tandem XML implemented in pyteomics.

This package provides a module that can be used for writing pepXML files
from your Python code, as well as a command-line script for conversion of
X!Tandem files to pepXML. Unlike its analog from Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP),
the script is capable of handling non-standard enzymes.
